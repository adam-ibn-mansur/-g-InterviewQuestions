# -g-InterviewQuestions
After scrolling the /g/ boards on 4chan for information on programming, 
I came across an intriguing and almost disturbing recount by a user who interviews candidates. 
Some of the questions looked unreasonably easy than expected, yet the user states some of the candidates - 
even the ones with upwards of 8 to 19 years of professional experience - could not do it. 
Out of curiosity, these were my attempts at some of those interview questions.
